# Homework-2
This homework involves using Boostrap 4 to make my first "website". We were tasked to make a page with an About me, Portfolio,
and contact pages. We were to use rows and columns. Also we needed to have a navbar and a footer. We also needed a responsive website and responsive images. Boostrap kind of makes the responsive stuff easier then if you had to do it all youself.. I would love to spend more time on this but I am turning this version in right now.

### My Process
I first started out by watching numerous videos on YouTube on boostraps design format. I found it very useful to start with the about me page and make my columns and rows **visible** by giving each individual class a border with different colors. This allowed me to see how many columns and rows I was working with. It also helped me with the orgaization of where to put certain things. I also worked on the footer and header (which honestly could be waaaaay better) in my opening hours of working on this homework. After the about me page and the navbar and footer were done, I moved on to the Portfolio page. I used the columns and rows to put 5 different pictures with links to my "projects" I have worked on. After that, I moved on to the contact page where I used the internet to help me.

### What I Liked
I honestly enjoyed working with boostrap and it was fun seeing somethings that we have learned in class actually come to life. I surprised myself with come CSS stuff (not like I did anything fancy at all) but when I thought something should do something, it ended up doing what I thought it would do (make sense?).

### What I didn't like
I wish I was better at sooooo many things. I never could get the navar to work quite like I wanted it to in boostrap. I also was not so good with the sticky footer. I feel like there are so many things I can improve on. I wanted to make evrything exactly like the example pictures but I just couldn't. I know we will all improve because this is literally my first time doing this.

### Overall
I think I can do better but i was please with a lot of the work I did.

Cheers
